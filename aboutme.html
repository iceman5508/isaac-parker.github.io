			<p>
				<b>Isaac Parker</b> is a creative perfectionist. In some ways I put
				a piece of myself in every work or project I do, regardless of how
				minimal it might be. I started on my path of creativity in late 2006
				thanks to sony. By this I mean that in late 2006, I recieved an
				original <b><a
					href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Portable">Playstation
						Portable (psp)</a></b> from a friend. What this firend did not
				tell me is that the disk drive was broken an was unable to play
				games. Once I realized this major limitation, I asked myself "what
				else can the psp do if not play games?"<br /> It was this
				fundimental question that led me to my programming path as well as
				in trouble with my parents as I started asking the same question
				about every other electronice device in our house.

				second version of the Engine is <b>IEngine for desktop</b>. This
				version is written in Java and can be used to create native desktop

				Both Versions of the Engine are primarily being used to teach

				involved in programming.
			
			
			<p>Both versions of the update will recieve periodic updates based on
				error I find or features that I believe are missing. However, user
